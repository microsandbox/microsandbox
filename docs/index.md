# INTRODUCTION

[!embed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23618f92-5897-44d1-bfa6-1058f30c09ef)

Run untrusted code with **VM-level isolation** and **lightning-fast startup**. Built for AI agents, developers, and anyone who needs to execute code safely without compromising on speed or security.

### Why microsandbox?

Ever needed to run code you don't fully trust? Whether it's AI-generated code, user submissions, or experimental code, the traditional options all have serious drawbacks:

{.list-icon}

- :icon-device-desktop: **Running locally** - One malicious script and your entire system is compromised
- :icon-alert: **Using containers** - Shared kernels mean sophisticated attacks can still break out
- :icon-clock: **Traditional VMs** - Waiting 10+ seconds for a VM to boot kills productivity and performance
- :icon-cloud: **Cloud solutions** - Can get expensive fast and at the whim of the cloud provider

**microsandbox** combines the best of all worlds:

{.list-icon}

- :icon-shield-lock: **Bulletproof Security** - True VM isolation with separate kernels
- :icon-zap: **Instant Startup** - Boot times under 200ms, not 10+ seconds
- :icon-home: **Your Infrastructure** - Self-hosted with complete control
- :icon-package: **OCI Compatible** - Works with standard container images
- :icon-dependabot: **AI-Ready** - Built-in MCP server for seamless AI integration

### What You Can Build

#### AI Code Execution Platforms

Build AI assistants that can safely execute the code they generate. Whether it's a simple Python script or a complex web application, your AI can run, test, and debug code in real-time without compromising your infrastructure. Perfect for coding assistants, educational platforms, and automated development workflows where AI needs to validate its own output.

#### Secure Data Analysis Services

Create platforms where users can upload datasets and run custom analysis scripts without security concerns. Support any data science stack - Python with pandas, R for statistics, Julia for high-performance computing - while maintaining complete isolation. Ideal for research institutions, business intelligence platforms, and collaborative data science environments.

#### Interactive Learning Environments

Deploy instant coding environments for education and training. Students can write, compile, and execute code in any programming language directly through their browser while you maintain complete security isolation. Perfect for coding bootcamps, online computer science courses, competitive programming platforms, and technical interview systems.

#### Continuous Integration & Testing

Rapidly prototype and test microservices in isolated environments. Spin up complete application stacks, test API integrations, and validate deployment configurations without affecting your main infrastructure. Great for CI/CD pipelines, integration testing, and proof-of-concept development.
